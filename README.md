## This App is a complete interactive shapes application with the following features:

A configurable **Container** component that can have:

- Background color (using Tailwind classes)
- Background image (using URLs)


A **Text** component with configurable:

* Font family
* Color
* Background color
* Size
* Position

A **Shape** component that supports multiple shapes:

Circle
* Square
* Star
* Heart
* Cloud
* Flower
* Butterfly
* Moon

Each **shape** has configurable:

* Color
* Opacity
* Size
* Border color and width
* Border radius (for square)
* Position
* Click animation (random from: scale, fade, slide, bounce, wobble, shake)
* Unique sound when clicked (using Tone.js)


### The app uses:

* Framer Motion for smooth animations
* Tone.js for sound generation
* TypeScript for type safety
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* SVG paths for shape rendering

Each shape plays a different musical note when clicked and has a random animation from the predefined set. The shapes are also interactive with hover effects and smooth transitions.

The development server should now be running, and you'll see the interactive shapes demo with various shapes arranged on the screen. Click on any shape to hear its unique sound and see a random animation!
